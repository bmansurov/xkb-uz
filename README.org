* Uzbek Cyrillic layout for xkb
  layout for easily typing both Cyrillic and Latin characters and symbols

** How to
   1. Clone the repository and overwrite the existing layout file. It's
      the easiest method. You'll have to repeat the process every time
      xkb symbols are updated:

      #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      git clone git@github.com:bmansurov/xkb-uz.git
      sudo cp xkb-uz/uz /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/
      #+END_SRC

   2. Create a file called ~/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-custom-kbd.conf~ with
      the following contents

      #+BEGIN_SRC conf
      Section "InputClass"
          # All options are here: man -P cat xkeyboard-config
          # Right alt is never a level 3 chooser.
          # Both shifts enable caps lock.
          # Caps lock is level 3 chooser.
          Option "XKbOptions" "shift:both_capslock,lv3:caps_switch"
      EndSection
      #+END_SRC

   3. Restart the X-Server.

   4. Now you can easily type the symbols available in the ~us~ keyboard
      with the level3 chooser like so:
      - CapsLock ғ :: -
      - CapsLock Ғ :: _
      - CapsLock Shift э :: "
      - etc.

   5. You can also type truly Cyrillic symbols like guillemets (angle
      quotes, «»):
      - Shift 2 :: «
      - CapsLock 2 :: »
